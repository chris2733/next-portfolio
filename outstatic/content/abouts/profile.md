Creative front end developer with 6 years experience across a wide range of industries, starting off as a self learner and ending up freelancing as I travel.

I specialise in React with NextJS at the moment, but have worked with Vue, Angular, Wordpress using ACF and a headless CMS, also writing a whole load of CSS with either SASS, bootstrap or tailwind and keeping an eye on accessibility.

Throughout my life I have had many different kinds of work experience to draw on, from an aircraft engineering degree, to social work and teaching English as a foreign language, to 3D printing. -check out my CV for more [here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1WO9DTH1gGcrrJKiIwlCtmu4ipBeE-W42/export?format=pdf).
